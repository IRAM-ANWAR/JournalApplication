Jar runs directly, war needs to be deployed on web server
Context Path-The context path is a prefix to the URL path used to identify and differentiate between different context(s). In Spring Boot, by default, the applications are accessed by context path “/”. That means we can access the application directly at http://localhost:PORT/. For example http://localhost:8080/
Maven - manage dependency, Build automation tool
maven install or maven wrapper - .mvn folder

Object creation -> Externalize
ApplicationContext is a way to achieve IOC -> Scan(@Component)
Bean- Object
Rest API- Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface- Http Verb+ URL

MongoDB - net start mongodb, net stop mongodb->  mongodb://localhost:27017( in shell)
collection(table)-> fields(columns)->document(rows)
use school -> will create this collection
show collections /  db.students.insertOne({"name":"Ram","age":20})  /  db.students.find().pretty()/ db.students.find({"name":"Ram","age":20})

ORM- technique to map java objects to database tables
Java Persistence API - set of rules,way to achieve ORM, includes interfaces and annotations that is used in Java classes, requires a persistence provider(ORM tools) for implementation.
ORM tools- specific implementation of JPA specification, Eh, Hibernate, EclipseLink and OpenJPA. These providers implement the JPA interfaces and provide the
underlying functionality to interact with database.

Spring Data JPA-  built on top of JPA, is not a JPA implementation. It simplifies working with JPA by providing higher level abstractions and utilities.
However, to use Spring Data JPA, still need a JPA implementation to handle actual the actual database interaction.
JPA not used with MongoDB. Spring Data MongoDB -persistence provider for MongoDB. It provides the necessary abstractions and implementations.
Query Method DSL and Criteria API are two ways to interact

Lombok- during compilation based on annotations

@EnableTransactionManagement - find method annotated with @Transactional and make transactional context(atomicity/container)
PlatformTransactionManager - MongoTransactionManager is implementation

SpringSecurity - authentication(who can access) and authorization(what access) - uses Http Basic Authentication
Authorization header: Basic <encoded-string>

Properties:-
Classpath- list of jar and libraries and configurations
src/main/resources - in classpath
commandline(program arguements)>application.properties>application.yml
commandline - --server.port=8081

@MockitoBean with @SpringBootTest

Jenkins -UI - To run commands
